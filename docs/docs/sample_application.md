# Houston, We Have Lift Off!

For your convenience, we set up a simple example application that connects to a ficticious NASA account at Oddworks, fetches data using a few of the [SDK Data Models](data_models.md) outlined further on in our Developer Guide, and displays that data to users in a visually pleasing application.

Getting up and running with Odd Networks on Android is as easy as following these 5 simple steps.

__Step 1__

Clone the GitHub project to your local machine.
